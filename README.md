## 🧹 Data Preparation & Semantic Layer:
To ensure data integrity and optimal dashboard performance, the following technical steps were implemented:

* **DAX Measure Development:** Authored complex calculated measures using DAX to track real-time KPIs, including Total Sales, Average Rating, and Year-over-Year growth simulations.
* **Star-Schema Modeling:** Designed a robust semantic model optimized for performance, utilizing a star-schema approach to facilitate seamless filtering across multiple dimensions (Outlet, Item Type, and Location).
* **Attribute Engineering:** Created custom groupings and bins for outlet sizes and item categories to provide deeper granularity in stakeholder reporting.
